/**
 * `@aihu/agent-service` — the capability authorization hook (aihu#871).
 *
 * Today's gate (`principal-gate.ts`'s `resolvePrincipal` + `decideEmission`,
 * routed through `runGate` in `agent-service.ts`) authorizes the `call`
 * axis — can this principal invoke this action/state AT ALL — but has no
 * per-request, per-resource hook for "is THIS row/record visible to THIS
 * actor". Hosts have been rolling that check themselves in application
 * code, which means client state and rendered HTML end up as the de facto
 * authorization authority: exactly what this hook exists to stop.
 *
 * `authorizeCapability` is that hook. Same injected-dependency posture as
 * `EntitlementsHandle` (`entitlements.ts`) and `AuthPlugin`: this package
 * defines only the structural contract and the fail-closed ladder; the host
 * supplies `resolve` (its own per-resource authorization logic) and wires it
 * in as `AgentServiceOptions.authorizeDataRead` so `runGate`'s data-read path
 * (`handleToolCall`'s `getSignal` dispatch) calls it before a value reaches
 * the response.
